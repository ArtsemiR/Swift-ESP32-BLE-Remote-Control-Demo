# Managing Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Connections in Swift Using CoreBluetooth
![](Demo-960-720-12.gif)

This Swift project demonstrates how to manage Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connections with ESP32 devices using ```CoreBluetooth``` framework. The application allows for discovering, connecting to, and communicating with ESP32 peripherals.

## Overview

## Configuration

### Info.plist

The `Info.plist` file is configured to request Bluetooth usage permission from the user:

```xml
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
    <string>This app uses Bluetooth to connect and control ESP32 devices.</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```
This setting is required for iOS apps that use Bluetooth features, ensuring the app complies with Apple's privacy guidelines.


### BLEManager.swift
#### Peripheral Structure
The Peripheral struct encapsulates data for a BLE device, including its UUID, name, RSSI (signal strength), advertised services, and a reference to CBPeripheral.

```swift
struct Peripheral: Identifiable {
    let id: UUID
    let name: String
    let rssi: Int
    let advertisementServiceUUIDs: [String]?
    let peripheral: CBPeripheral
}
```

#### BLEManager Class
The ```BLEManager``` class is designed to work within a SwiftUI context, conforming to ObservableObject for UI updates. Additionally, it implements ```CBCentralManagerDelegate``` and ```CBPeripheralDelegate``` protocols to manage BLE connections.

ESP32 **Identifiers** determined during programming of this board here - https://github.com/ArtsemiR/ESP32-BLE-Remote-Control-Demo
```swift
class BLEManager: NSObject, ObservableObject, CBCentralManagerDelegate, CBPeripheralDelegate {
    // UUIDs for ESP32 BLE service and characteristic.
    enum ESP32Constants {
        static let serviceUUID = "4fafc201-1fb5-459e-8fcc-c5c9c331914b"
        static let characteristicUUID = "beb5483e-36e1-4688-b7f5-ea07361b26a8"
    }

    var centralManager: CBCentralManager!
    var esp32Peripheral: CBPeripheral?
    var esp32Characteristic: CBCharacteristic?

    @Published var peripherals: [Peripheral] = []
    @Published var isConnected = false // Indicates if the app is connected to a peripheral.
    @Published var bootButtonState = false // Tracks the state of the BOOT button.

    // Function implementations...
}
```

#### Setting Up the Central Manager
```swift
override init() {
    super.init()
    centralManager = CBCentralManager(delegate: self, queue: nil)
}
```
>**Key Function**: Initializes the BLEManager and sets up the central manager, which is responsible for managing BLE connections.\
>**Working Principle**: When an instance of BLEManager is created, it automatically creates a CBCentralManager. This central manager is crucial for any BLE operation, as it scans for, connects to, and manages data exchange with BLE peripherals.

### Central Manager Delegate Methods

```swift
func centralManagerDidUpdateState(_ central: CBCentralManager)
```
>**Key Function** Responds to changes in the BLE hardware state.\
>**Working Principle**: Automatically invoked whenever the state of the central manager changes (e.g., when Bluetooth is turned on or off). It’s essential for monitoring the readiness of the device’s BLE hardware.

```swift
func centralManager(_ central: CBCentralManager, didDiscover peripheral: CBPeripheral, advertisementData: [String: Any], rssi RSSI: NSNumber)
```
>**Key Function**: Handles the discovery of BLE peripherals.\
>**Working Principle**: Called each time the central manager discovers a BLE peripheral while scanning. It filters and adds ESP32 devices to the list of peripherals, making them available for connection.

```swift
func centralManager(_ central: CBCentralManager, didConnect peripheral: CBPeripheral)
```
>**Key Function**: Manages actions after successfully connecting to a peripheral.\
>**Working Principle**: Triggered when a connection is successfully established. It's used to start the discovery of services provided by the peripheral, marking the beginning of detailed communication.

```swift
func centralManager(_ central: CBCentralManager, didDisconnectPeripheral peripheral: CBPeripheral, error: Error?)
```
>**Key Function**: Handles the peripheral disconnection process.\
>**Working Principle**: Invoked when the peripheral is disconnected, either intentionally or due to an error. It resets the connection state and can trigger a re-scan for devices.

### Peripheral Delegate Methods

```swift
func peripheral(_ peripheral: CBPeripheral, didDiscoverServices error: Error?)
```
>**Key Function**: Identifies services provided by the peripheral.\
>**Working Principle**: Called after services of the connected peripheral are discovered. This function initiates the discovery of characteristics, which are specific capabilities or data points of the BLE service.

```swift
func peripheral(_ peripheral: CBPeripheral, didDiscoverCharacteristicsFor service: CBService, error: Error?)
```
>**Key Function**: Discovers the characteristics of a service.\
>**Working Principle**: Once services are identified, this function looks for their characteristics. It's crucial for finding the right channel to send or receive data from the BLE device.

```swift
func peripheral(_ peripheral: CBPeripheral, didUpdateValueFor characteristic: CBCharacteristic, error: Error?)
```
>**Key Function**: Handles updates to the characteristics’ values.\
>**Working Principle**: Notified when there’s new data from the peripheral. This is where the app can process incoming data, such as sensor readings or status updates from the BLE device.

```swift
func peripheral(_ peripheral: CBPeripheral, didWriteValueFor characteristic: CBCharacteristic, error: Error?)
```
>**Key Function**: Confirms that data was successfully written to a characteristic.\
>**Working Principle**: Called when a write operation to the peripheral’s characteristic is completed. It's useful for confirming that the data sent to the BLE device was received and processed.
